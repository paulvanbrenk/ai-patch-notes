## Epic: Sync Refactor

Refactor the sync tool to intelligently fetch releases and generate grouped summaries using AI (ollama/cloud).

### Feature: Release Fetching

- [ ] Fetch new releases for each package based on `LastFetchedAt`
- [ ] Detect releases that are new or missing summaries
- [ ] Track which releases need summary generation

### Feature: External Changelog Resolution

Handle releases that link to external changelog files instead of containing release notes directly (e.g., Vite's "Please refer to CHANGELOG.md for details" pattern).

- [ ] Detect minimal release bodies that reference external files (CHANGELOG.md, HISTORY.md, etc.)
- [ ] Parse changelog link from release body (supports relative and absolute GitHub URLs)
- [ ] Fetch external changelog file content from GitHub API
- [ ] Extract relevant version section from changelog (match version tag to changelog heading)
- [ ] Handle common changelog formats (Keep a Changelog, conventional commits, custom formats)
- [ ] Cache fetched changelog content to avoid redundant requests
- [ ] Fallback gracefully if changelog fetch/parse fails (keep original release body)

### Feature: Version Grouping

- [ ] Parse semantic versions from release tags
- [ ] Group releases by major version (e.g., 15.x, 16.x)
- [ ] Separate pre-release versions (alpha, beta, canary, rc, next, nightly) from stable
- [ ] Handle edge cases (non-semver tags, monorepo tags like `@package/v1.0.0`)
- [ ] Example: next.js 15.1, 16.1, 16.2-canary → 3 groups (15.x stable, 16.x stable, 16.x canary)

### Feature: Summary Generation

- [ ] Create `ReleaseSummary` entity (packageId, majorVersion, isPrerelease, summary, generatedAt)
- [ ] Add migration for `ReleaseSummary` table
- [ ] Generate summary per version group using AI (ollama local / cloud fallback)
- [ ] Aggregate release notes within a group for context
- [ ] Update summaries when new releases are added to a group
- [ ] Add configuration for AI provider (ollama URL, cloud API key)

### Feature: API Updates

- [ ] Add `GET /api/packages/{id}/summaries` endpoint (get all summaries for a package)
- [ ] Add `GET /api/summaries` endpoint (query summaries across packages)
- [ ] Include summary data in release responses where applicable

---

## Epic: User Settings

### Feature: Backend

- [ ] Create `UserSettings` entity (userId, showPrereleases, compactView, etc.)
- [ ] Add migration for `UserSettings` table

- [ ] Add `PATCH /api/users/me/settings` endpoint

### Feature: Frontend

- [ ] Create settings API hooks (`useUserSettings`, `useUpdateUserSettings`)

- [ ] Apply settings to release display (prerelease filter, compact view)
- [ ] Handle unauthenticated users (localStorage fallback or disable settings)
