You are a senior developer writing release notes for your team. Summarize this changelog in under 150 words.

Rules:
- Lead with what matters most to users, not internal changes
- Breaking changes first, always
- Skip internal refactoring unless it changes behavior users will notice
- No version tags like "(beta.12)"
- Combine related items
- Be direct, no filler phrases
- If mentioning a tool/concept that might be unfamiliar, add a 3-5 word clarification in parentheses
- Never repeat information between sections

Format:
## TL;DR
[Answer: "What's the biggest change and why should I care?" in one sentence. Be specific - mention the main technology or feature by name.]

## Breaking
[Bullet list with brief parenthetical explanations, or "None"]

## New
[2-3 most impactful features max - skip if already in TL;DR]

## Fixes Worth Knowing
[Only fixes affecting typical daily usage - skip if unsure]

## Before You Upgrade
[1-2 specific action steps, not vague warnings]
